```{r}
library(BiocManager)
```
```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```

Today we examine a published RNA-seq experiment where airway smooth muscle cells were treated with dexam

We need tow things :
-1:count data
2: col data

```{r}
counts <- read.csv("airway_scaledcounts.csv", row.names = 1)
metadata <-  read.csv("airway_metadata.csv")
```

```{r}
head(counts)
```

```{r}
head(metadata)
```

Side note:
Let's check the corespondance of the metadata nad count data setup.
i.e. check if the first column of metadata is the same as the counts column headers

```{r}
metadata[1]
```

```{r}
colnames(counts)==metadata[1]
```

wrap the above code in all to tell us if all the outputs are true

```{r}
all(colnames(counts)==metadata[1])
```
##compare control to treated 
First we need to access all the control columns in our counts data.
This is in the column "dex"
using control.inds in [ ] gets that row of Trues and "1" gets the first col of this


```{r}
control.inds <- metadata$dex=="control"
metadata[control.inds,1]
```

Use these ids to access just the control columns of our 'counts' data
```{r}
control.ids <- metadata[control.inds,]$id
control.ids
```

```{r}
control.mean <- rowMeans(counts[,control.ids])
head(control.mean)
```

##Do the same for the drug tested
```{r}
treated.id <- metadata[metadata$dex == "treated",]$id
treated.mean <- rowMeans(counts[,treated.id])
```

We will combine our meancount data for bookkeeping purposes.

```{r}
meancounts <- data.frame(control.mean, treated.mean)
```

Use the ` beside the 1 in the keyboard to also use code in this r,markdown \
it will only show up in the r script:
There are `r nrow(counts)` rows/genes in this dataset

##how many genes in this dataset
```{r}
nrow(counts)
```

##Compare the control and treated

A quick plot of our progress so far

```{r}
plot(meancounts)
```

This plot (above) needs to be altered to make it clearer. A log would be v useful

```{r}
plot(meancounts, log = "xy")
```

We often use log transformations as they make life much easier...

```{r}
log2(10/20)
```

```{r}
log2(80/20)
```

```{r}
meancounts$log2fc <- log2(meancounts[,"treated.mean"]/meancounts[,"control.mean"])
head(meancounts)
```

Let's look for zeros in the meancounts

```{r}
head(meancounts[,1:2])
```

```{r}
head(meancounts[,1:2] == 0)
```

The which() function tells us the indices of TRUE entries in a logical vector

However, it is not useful in default mode on our type of multi column input...

```{r}
inds <- which(meancounts[,1:2] == 0, arr.ind = TRUE)
head(inds)
```
I only care about the rows here (if there is a zero in any column I will exclude this row eventually).

```{r}
to.rm <- unique(sort(inds[,"row"]))
```



```{r}
head(meancounts[to.rm,])
```

```{r}
mycounts <- meancounts[-to.rm,]
head(mycounts)
```


We now have `r nrow(mycounts)` genes remaining

```{r}
nrow(mycounts)
```

How many of these genes are upregulated at the log2 fold-change threshold of +2 or greater

```{r}
sum(mycounts$log2fc > 2)
```

What is the percentage of this?

```{r}
round((sum(mycounts$log2fc > 2) / nrow(mycounts)) *100,2)
```
The calculate down regulated

```{r}
sum(mycounts$log2fc < -2)
```

```{r}
round((sum(mycounts$log2fc < -2) / nrow(mycounts)) *100,2)
```

#DESeq2 analysis
We first need to set up the DESeq input object

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, 
                              colData=metadata, 
                              design=~dex)
dds
```
Run the DESeq analysis pipeline
```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

```{r}
res <-  results(dds)
head(res)
```

# A Volcano plot 

This is a very common data viz of this type of data that does not really look like a volcano
abline creates a line

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj))
abline(v=c(-2,2), col="gray")
abline(h=-log(0.05), col="gray")
```

##Adding annotation data
We want to add meaningful gene names to our dataset so we can make some sense of what is going on here..

For this we will use two bioconductor packages, one does the work and is called **AnnotationDbi**. The other contains the data we are going to map between and is called **org.Hs.eg.db**

```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")
```

```{r}
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

Here we map to "SYMBOL" the common gene name that the world understands and wants

```{r}
res$symbol <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=row.names(res), # Our genenames
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        # The format of our genenames
                     column="SYMBOL",          # The new format we want to add
                     multiVals="first")
head(res$symbol)
```

```{r}
head(res)
```

Lets save our results to date. 

```{r}
write.csv(res, file = "class15_allmyresults.csv")
```


##Pathway analysis

Let's try bring some insight back into this work.
For this we will start with KEGG.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)

data(kegg.sets.hs)

# Examine the first 2 pathways in this kegg set for humans
head(kegg.sets.hs, 2)
```


Before we can use KEGG we need to get our gene identifiers in the correct format for KEGG, which is ENTREZ format in this case

```{r}
head(rownames(res))
```

need to translate the rownames above into entrez format


```{r}
head(columns(org.Hs.eg.db))
```

```{r}
res$entrez <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, 
                     keys=row.names(res),
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",
                     column="ENTREZID",
                     multiVals="first")
```


The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

Note that we used the mapIDs() function above to obtain Entrez gene IDs (stored in res$entrez) and we have the fold change results from DESeq2 analysis (stored in res$log2FoldChange).


```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
head(foldchanges)
```

assign names to this vector that are the gene IDs that KEGG wants

```{r}
names(foldchanges) <- res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Now we can pass this to the gage() function

```{r}
#get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

We can look at the attributes() of an object

```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```

```{r}
head(keggres$less)
```

The pathview() function will add our genes to a KEGG pathway as colored entries:


```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa05310")
```
